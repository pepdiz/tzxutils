I couldn't find any reference to a license in the original work but a copyright notice, so I assume public domain. 
My work (this repo) will be under GPL v3 license, the initial commit will be the exact oringinal and so original license apply. For any complaint please contact me.

Original work was compiled with Watcom C 10.0+ and provide executable versions of the tools, these executables are not included in the repository. Anyway original version is include as a zip file including original executables.
