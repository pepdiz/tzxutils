                           TAP to TZX Converter
                                   v0.12b

  This utility will let you convert standard .TAP files to .TZX format. This
could be usefull if you want to replay .TAP files using the PLAYTZX utility
or convert them to .VOC format. A standard pause of 1 second will be put after
every converted block.

  Syntax is simple... :  TAP2TZX INPUT.TAP [OUTPUT.TZX]

  If OUTPUT.TZX is not given then the INPUT filename will be used, but its
extension will be changed to .TZX.

HISTORY:  0.11 - Some minor bugs removed, ANSI stuff removed as well
          0.12 - Create 1.03 version TZX files, Last Pause is always 0 seconds.

  If you are looking for sample .TZX files then the best place (for now) is
the homepage of this format:  http://www.uni-mb.si/~uel047r1a/ZXTape .
The latest revision of the ZXTape format and of all these utilties together
with others that use this format can be found at that page too.
