                TAP -> VOC Converter & Play TAP on SoundBlaster

                                  v0.04 beta

  This utility will  convert  tapes  in  C64  .TAP  format  (used  by the CCS64
emulator) to 8-Bit Mono .VOC files and it is able to PLAY .TAP  files  on  your
SoundBlaster  so  you  can  record them back to tape and then play them on real
C64.

  Usage :

     64TAPVOC [switches] FILE.TAP [OUTPUT.VOC]
    ----------
Switches:

  /play     Will Play the .TAP file on your Soundblaster.  (if you don't supply
            this switch then the .TAP file will be converted to .VOC format!)

  /freq n   Use Frequency of n Hz for SB play or conversion to .VOC format.  By
            default  the 44100 Hz is used when playing the .TAP on Soundblaster
            and 30303 Hz is  used  when  converting  to .VOC format.  With this
            option you can specify any frequency you like.

  /reverse  This will invert the signal. Try this switch if the tape doesn't
            load (especially on the real c64 !)

  If you are replaying the file through your SoundBlaster then you can stop the
replay at any time by pressing any key.

  Use "SPACE" key to Pause the tape while playing !

  So far this was thoroughly tested on my Cyrix P166+ and SB AWE32, but I got
reports of it working on several other configurations ...

  There could be problems if you have the IRQ setting of the SoundBlaster set
to higher than 7 ... or DMA higher than 5.

                             !!! IMPORTANT !!!
                            -------------------
When first trying to play something on the Soundblaster use lower settings and
built up to higher ones or else you might damage the equipment or SoundBlaster.
I cannot be held responsible if anything like that happens...


HISTORY:  0.01 - * Released to some beta-testers only.
          0.02 - * First Public release, fixes some minor bugs.
          0.03 - * Frequency higher than 20kHz is handled properly now in all
                   utilities
          0.04 - * Updated after YEARS!
                   Added /reverse switch (so it loads into real C64)!
                   Added support for Version 1 TAP files (Pause changed)
                   Use "SPACE" key to Pause the tape while playing !

  This is the last version of this program - because of the lack of support
by the C64 community the TZX implementation for C64 is discontinued.
