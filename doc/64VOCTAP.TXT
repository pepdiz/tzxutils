                             VOC -> TAP Converter

                                  v0.04 beta

  This utility will convert tapes in 8-bit Mono .VOC format to .TAP format used
by the CCS64 emulator.   This  is  not  so  trivial and straight-forward as you
would think since you have to get the volume and other settings right when  you
are making the .VOC file.  To overcome some problems there is (only) one switch
which can improve the conversion.

  Usage :

     64VOCTAP FILE.VOC [OUTPUT.TAP]
    ----------
Switches:

   /tresh n This will set the  'Treshold' to n.  By default the Treshold is set
            to 127 and should be good for most of the tapes.  However all sound
            cards don't produce very clean  signal  and it can shift up/down so
            you can set the treshold manually here...  the  valid  numbers  are
            from  0  to  255,  BUT  don't set it too much off 127, +- 10 should
            suffice !

  This version does  NOT  need  the  /shift  command  line  option anymore, the
detection is made automagically by the converter now !

  If you don't supply the OUTPUT filename then the INPUT filename will be used,
but the extension will be changed to .TAP .

  The conversion is pretty quick and it needs as much memory as the  .VOC  file
length (sorry, but I didn't bother with reading of VOC file in 'chunks') - i.e.
if  the  VOC file is 12MB big then you will need 12MB of free memory !!!  Maybe
in next versions this will be fixed...


HISTORY:  0.01 - * Released to some beta-testers only.
          0.02 - * First Public release, fixes some minor bugs.
          0.03 - * Added two switches to 64VOCTAP which should improve the
                   conversion results:
                   /shift   - which 'shifts' the VOC by one pulse  &
                   /tresh n - which sets the 'treshold' value to n [0-255]
          0.04 - * Removed the /shift switch since this is determined
                   automatically now

  This is the last version of this program - because of the lack of support
by the C64 community the TZX implementation for C64 is discontinued.
